The Sensor Data Processing System is designed to read sensor data, validate its format, compute monthly statistics, detect outliers, and generate reports. 
It also includes an error-handling module for logging errors.
Features:
Data Ingestion: Reads sensor data (sensor_data.csv) and threshold values (thresholds.csv).
Validation: Ensures data format correctness and handles missing values.
Processing: Computes monthly average, minimum, and maximum values.
Outlier Detection: Identifies readings beyond defined thresholds.
Reporting: Generates reports (monthly_stats.csv and outliers.csv).
Error Handling: Logs errors related to missing files, incorrect data formats, and processing failures.
